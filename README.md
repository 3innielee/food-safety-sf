Food Safety from the Perspective of Restaurant Inspections in San Francisco.

## 1. Initial Hypotheses
* Inspections increase food safety.
* Restaurants with high performance on inspections tends to cluster together. In other words, if a restaurant gets a high inspection score then the neighboring restaurants tend to have high scores too.

## 2. Data Sources
### 2.1. Description
### 2.2. Sources
The [data source](https://extxfer.sfdph.org/) is the restaurant Inspections data from [San Francisco Department of Public Health](https://www.sfdph.org/). It is updated daily, and I use the data from the oldest date, February 19, 2015, to February 16, 2018 for this analysis.

The datasets I use are listed as following:
The businesses.csv file contains information about businesses. 
The inspections.csv file contains information about inspectorsâ€™ visits to businesses.
